## Description

ft_printf is a project that required me to recode almost exactly the printf function of <stdio.h>.
Although the original one has more features (floating numbers, color syntax) mine is about 30% faster, wich is a big deal when you're trying to formate a massive amount of strings.

## Getting Started

Start by compiling the library using the `Make` command

Then you will need to include the header of the library `inc/ft_printf.h` and then include `libftprintf.a` when you compile your program.

## Usage

Just use `ft_printf` as if you were using the original one and it should word exactly as intended ðŸ˜‰
As a side note, you can also use `ft_dprintf` if you want to write to a custom file descriptor.
